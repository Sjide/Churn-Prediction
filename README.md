PowerCo  Customers Churn Prediction Model

Power Co Churn Analysis
Powerco is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies corporate, SME (Small & Medium enterprises), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.
